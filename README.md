# GitHub Stat Checker

GitHub Contribution Tracker is a **Streamlit** web application that visualizes GitHub user contributions with insightful metrics, charts, and achievements. This app uses the **GitHub GraphQL API** to fetch and display data about a user's contribution history, enabling users to track and analyze their growth.

**ℹ️  _Now predicts user contribution over a year using previous year's contribution data_**
